# Open source patches with vvvv gamma

You can use the source to run or integrate with other vvvv gamma projects. For pre-compiled releases, see below.

Last tested version: vvvv gamma 5.2 stable
Download at http://visualprogramming.net/

- Go to the `Main/gamma` folder and open `Schema_Minimal.vl` (no extra blocks, plugins, basic startup experience) or `Schema_Studio.vl` (all available blocks, plugins and project selection)
- A console focused version with Linux support is available with `Schema_Lite.vl`
- If you see red, open patches and install missing dependencies. These include `ncalc`, `csv`, `VL.IO.Xbox360Controller`, ...
- Dig around! Feel free to raise questions/issues/requests in Github issues here or on Discord

As a sidenote, some patches are objectively messy, some quite nice. You're in for a ride.
