# scnq-schema
Intuitive realtime programming of physical devices such as lights, motors and more, I'll make it into an mmo game one day I promise

# Open with vvvv gamma

Last tested version: 2021.4.9 stable
http://visualprogramming.net/

- Go to the `gamma` folder and open `Schema_Minimal.vl` (no extra blocks, plugins, basic startup experience) or `Schema_Preview.vl` (all available blocks, plugins and project selection)
- If you see red, open patches and install missing dependencies. These include `ncalc`, `csv`, `VL.IO.Xbox360Controller`, ...
- Dig around! Feel free to raise questions/issues/requests in Github issues here or on Discord

As a sidenote, some patches are objectively messy, some quite nice. You're in for a ride.
